There's a lot of moving pieces here, try to recreate each

First solve it using pwntools in python

Then make start into a service

    socat TCP4-LISTEN:31338,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"./start"

Confirm the python script works

Now, create a ruby version and confirm it works.

Make the ruby code really small (higher order functions for the win)

When that doesn't work, run the ruby server on its own

    socat TCP4-LISTEN:31337,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"./server.rb"

Add calls to sleep (not sure if they helped). Observe that z.interact isn't going to work. We get one function
per call. Let's get some debug info.

    STDERR.reopen(STDOUT)

Look for the flag, we appear to be in the root directory

  ls  /
  ls  /home/
  ls  /home/start
  cat /homt/start/flag
